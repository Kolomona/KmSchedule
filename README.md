# KmSchedule

A simple online work schedule poster for small businesses where schedules are typically made using spreadsheets.

## Update
This is a complete rewrite of my hand made scheduling system. This version is based upon Laravel and is much snazzier and more secure than my previous version.

## The Problem

You are a manager of a small restaurant responsible for making and posting the schedule for your employees.

You use a spreadsheet to make the schedule. Then you print it and post it in the employee area for all to view.

Employees will often call you to ask when they are working (this is annoying)

Or they do not see the schedule and don't show up for their shifts (also annoying)

You may have tried to group text a picture of the schedule to them. Managing everyone's changing phone numbers is also very annoying.

## The Solution

With KmSchedule you still use your familiar spreadsheet program to make quick and easy edits to the schedule.

Select all the information and copy it.

Then you navigate to your company's website schedule section ie. http://kmschedule.yourcompany.com

Log in, click the Admin button and select "Add New Schedule".

Copy the schedule from your spreadsheet and paste it.

Enter the date in the date field and click **Create Schedule**.

** That's it. Your done! **

When your employees visit http://www.yourcompany.com/schedule after logging in they should see the latest schedule.


## Requirements

KmSchedule has been tested using the following. While it should work with other web servers I haven't tested them.
* Apache
* php
* mysql
